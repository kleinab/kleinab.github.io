        <h2>Master's of Engineering Thesis: <a href="http://caesar.eecs.mit.edu/">Caesar</a></h2>
        <h4>How can teachers deliver qualitative feedback to 20,000 students in a software engineering class?</h4>
        <p>Code review is invaluable to learning software engineering.  Students receive useful comments and corrections, get exposure to various coding styles, and gain experience reviewing code.  However, code review is time-consuming for staff members who need to moderate and review all student code.  This will become more difficult as software engineering courses move online and class sizes become exponentially larger.</p>
        <p>My goal is to make code review more efficient by allowing staff members to give the same feedback to students who make similar mistakes on their assignments.  By doing so, students will receive the same feedback on their code but staff members will significantly increase their coverage of student code.  My thesis consists of creating two search tools to support staff members in code review:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Increase comment-writing efficiency by searching through previous comments</li>
                <li>Find examples of repeated mistakes made by multiple students by searching for patterns in code</li>
            </ol>
        <p>I am working with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rcm/">Professor Rob Miller</a> in the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/">User Interface Design Group</a> in MIT's <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>.</p>

During this class, I had the opportunity to use my skills to help a person in the community.  Through this, I learned a lot about human-centered design given a large number of constraints.  This year, I am a lab assistant for the class.  I mentor a team of students and am organizing a lecture.</p>
